**Hello I am a cool index page**


<h3 id='jekyll_is_different'>Jekyll is Different.</h3>

<p>Actually Jekyll was pretty damned frustrating when I started out - which is why I created Jekyll-bootstrap. But aside from that, jekyll just feels right to me.</p>

<h3 id='i_want_to_write_articles_like_i_write_code'>I want to write articles like I write code.</h3>

<p>So this time I feel like I&#8217;ve got something here. This time I feel like Jekyll can finally be the motivation I need - the convenience I crave - that gets me posting and sharing on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As for my first flurry of content, I would like to share everything I learned about using Jekyll<br /><strong>- and that&#8217;s Jekyll-bootstrap</strong>.</p>

<p>Jekyll-bootstrap is maintained by me, <a href='http://plusjade.com'>Jade Dominguez</a>. I encourage everyone to check out the <a href='contributing.html'>contribute</a> page if you are interested in helping. =)</p>

<p>Mostly I try to contribute to GitHub-backed projects because I have a not-so-secret mission to somehow work for GitHub in the near future. I still need to plan my attack though. But if anyone can help, please <a href='http://plusjade.com'>contact me</a>!</p>
